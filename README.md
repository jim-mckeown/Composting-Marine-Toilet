# Composting-Marine-Toilet
Documentation to reproduce a composting marine toilet that is the same height as a standard Jabsco type III.

This urine diverting composting toilet was designed to replace the type III originally installed by the boat manufacturer. There is no commercial composting toilet available that would fit because of the height. The shortest one I could find is a C-Head 'Shorty' model and it is too tall.

All components are off-the-shelf except for the urine diverter. This component was 3-D printed on a 200 x 200 mm print bed in 5 parts and glued together. The solid container is a standard paint bucket from HomeDepot. The liquid container is a small size bleach bottle.
